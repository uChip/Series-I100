StdBx is an effort to make it easier to create DIY electronics project with professional looking panels and enclosures like the one above.

Series-I100 is the first design point in the StdBx collection.  It is designed such that no circuit board needs to be larger than what the free version of the Eagle CAD PCB design tool supports.  Only one circuit board is needed for most applications.

Series-I100 is an add-on to the EagleCAD PCB design software that designs the front panel as you design your PCB.  It is easy to use following these steps.

1) Design your circuit using Eagle's schematic capture tool.  For displays, buttons, switches, encoders, potentiometers and LEDs choose components from the Series-I100 library.  Include the Series-I100 board definition from the library.  
2) Place the display and control components using Eagle's PCB layout tool and route the circuit.  
3) Add any labels you would like to have on the panel.  
4) Export the panel definition using the CAM file and scripts provided.
5) Order your panel from a laser cutting service like Pololu using the exported files.  Panels typically cost about $12.

That's it.  The board fits in the described enclosure which can be printed on your 3D printer or by a service like Shapeways.
